Calculate Solar Age

Age constructor


1. This will calculate a persons age comparing Earths to other planets:

Mercury (.24 Earth years) = earth age / .24
Venus (.62 Earth years) = persons age / .62
Mars (1.88 Earth years) = persons age / 1.88
Jupiter (11.86 Earth years) = persons age / 11.86

2. Calculate life expectancy each person has left on each planet based on overall average of all humans in US:
currently 78 years 

mercuryLifeExpect = (78 / .24) - persons age
venusLifeExpect = (78 / .62) - persons age
marsLifeExpect = (78 / 1.88) - persons age
jupiterLifeExpect = (78 / 11.86) - persons age


3. Calculate how many years person has lived beyond life expectancy

Mercury = if (mercuryLifeExpect > avgLifeExpect)
  return avgLifeExpect - mercuryAge

Venus = if (venusLifeExpect > avgLifeExpect)
  return avgLifeExpect - venusAge

Mars = if (marsLifeExpect > avgLifeExpect)
  return avgLifeExpect - marsAge

Jupiter = if (jupiterLifeExpect > avgLifeExpect)
  return avgLifeExpect - jupiterAge

  if solarAge === mercury {
     return earthAge/.24
  }
