Calculate Solar Age

This will calculate a persons age comparing Earths to other planets:

Mercury (.24 Earth years) = persons age / .24
Venus (.62 Earth years) = persons age / .62
Mars (1.88 Earth years) = persons age / 1.88
Jupiter (11.86 Earth years) = persons age / 11.86

Calculate life expectancy each person has left on each planet based on overall average of all humans in US:
currently 78 years 

Mercury = (78 / .24) - persons age
Venus = (78 / .62) - persons age
Mars = (78 / 1.88) - persons age
Jupiter = (78 / 11.86) - persons age


Calculate how many years person has lived beyond life expectancy

Mercury = if (mercuryLifeExpect > avgLifeExpect)
  return avgLifeExpect - mercuryAge
